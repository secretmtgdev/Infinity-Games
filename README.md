# Infinity Games 

## Description 
I've been wanting to create a  site for awhile to showcase some of the most powerful cards in all of Magic's history but then I got to thinking; Why not create a site that will help my friends and I when we play Magic the Gathering and thus this repo was born!

## How to run 
So.... due to CORS there are some issues with xmlHttpRequests and in order to bypass that you'll need to run a simple server from the same directory that the project lives in.
- run **_npm i -g http-server_** to install a simple server 
- run **_http-server -c-1_** to start the server 
- navigate to _http://localhost:8080/infinite.html_

## Update 
Migrating the code to the Trigger Ajax Repo
